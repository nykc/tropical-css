Tropical-CSS is a CSS grid based framework build with rapid development and prototyping in mind.

Current state is in early stages, but currently works as a fully functional basic framework.


## Installing Tropical-CSS into a root directory

Using the installer script assumes compass, sass, bower and git are installed. It was created to
expedite my setup process, working on a macbook pro.

At present time, this script assumes local development is done in ~/Sites or it will not execute properly.

This script is custom tailored for my personal development processes, mileage will vary so be sure
to carefully read the following bullet points, which describes what this script will do, then feel
free to modify accordingly.

  - create a new directory and give it a name (eg., my-directory)
  - copy over the config.rb, index.html and .gitignore files to your new directory
  - copy over the tropical.scss, style.scss files to your new directory
  - compile sass files with compass
  - run bower to include jquery
  - create an empty git repository
  - commit to branch (master) and make initial commit
  - create and switch to development branch based off master branch
